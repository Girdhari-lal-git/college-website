This teaching philosophy enables student community to learn and simultaneously make scientific contribution to society. We are committed to deliver an excellent graduate program of study as well as provide an opportunity for cutting-edge research in all natural and applied sciences.

I feel elated to introduce you to the Department of Applied Sciences which is the foundation of Engineers that strives for increasing the knowledge, enhancing the critical thinking, ability to change information into knowledge and power of analyzing things technically.

Department of Applied Sciences plays a vital role in an engineering college catering to the teaching of basic Sciences and Humanities courses for engineering students of all branches. The purpose of applied sciences in Engineering study is to lay a strong foundation of basic principles of various disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Computers, Electronics, Mechanics and Communication Skills in the mind of the learners, so that they proceed to rest of their years of study with up to date knowledge and training of basic engineering skills.
